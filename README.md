# Word2vec-Translation-Matrix
A simple python script that emulates the experiment in Tomas Milokov's paper "Exploiting Similarities among Languages for Machine Translation".

Based on [https://github.com/ramanan-r/word2vec_translation](https://github.com/ramanan-r/word2vec_translation?tab=readme-ov-file). Some bugs have been fixed and some updates to gensim have been handled.

Wiki pre-trained word vectors are available [here](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/pretrained-vectors.html). These vectors in dimension 300 were obtained using the skip-gram model described in Bojanowski et al. (2016) with default parameters. Download English and Tamil models.
